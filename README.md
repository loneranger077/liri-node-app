This app takes in one of four commands: spotify-this-song, movie-this, concert-this, and do-what-it-says. Spotify-this-song retrieves track info from the Spotify API for whatever song title you input. Movie-this retrieves film information from the OMDB API for whichever movie you input, and concert-this retrieves information about upcoming shows for whichever artist you input. Do-what-it-says is a snarky one-off command that executes spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way" by the Backstreet Boys. The format for inputting commands on the command line is as follows: "node liri.js spotify-this-song money". Enjoy!
